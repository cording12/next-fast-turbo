## What is Next-Fast-Turbo?

Next-Fast-Turbo is designed as a personal starter kit for Next.js and FastAPI projects. It is a monorepo that includes a Next.js frontend and a FastAPI backend. The project is designed to be deployed to Vercel, but can be deployed to any platform that supports monorepos.
