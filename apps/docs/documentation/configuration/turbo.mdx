## Introduction
This project was first created using the `create-turbo` npm package:

<CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npx create-turbo@latest
    ```
    
    ```bash yarn
    yarn dlx create-turbo@latest
    ```
    
    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest
    ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>It is recommended that you read through the [official documentation](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/getting-started/create-new) to understand the breakdown of the monorepo.</Note>

## Changes to the official Turbo starter
The official Turbo starter is a great starting point for a monorepo, but it has some configurations I did not need. As I will not be sharing code between the backend and frontend (nor the docs), I have **removed** the `packages/ui` directory.

If you want to **add a new package** to the project, please reference the [official documentation](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/sharing-code/internal-packages). 

For quick reference:
  1. Create a new folder in `packages/<folder>`
  2. Add a `package.json`, with `name` and `types` pointing at `src/index.ts[x]`
  3. Add `src/index.ts[x]`, with at least one named export
  4. Install your packages from `root`


## Turbo.json
The currently configured `turbo.json` does not have many changes from the official starter. The only change is the addition of the `globalEnv` key.

```json
{
  "globalEnv": [
    "NODE_ENV"
  ],
}
```
Without adding these environment variables to the `globalEnv`, you will receive an eslint error when referencing variables in your `.env`, however, your code will still work.

<Warning>
There are different ways that people solve this. While it's possible to use\
`"globalDependencies": ["**/.env"]`, that did not work in this project.\
